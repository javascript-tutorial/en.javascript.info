# What's the scroll from the bottom?

The `elem.scrollTop` property is the size of the scrolled out part from the top. How to get the size from the bottom scroll (let's call it `scrollBottom`)?

Write the code that works for an arbitrary `elem`.

P.S. Please check your code: if there's no scroll or the element is fully scrolled down, then it should return `0`.
