# Styles and classes

Before we get into JavaScript's ways of dealing with styles and classes -- here's an important rule. Hopefully it's obvious enough, but we still have to mention it.

There are generally two ways to style an element:

1. Create a class in CSS and add it: `<div class="...">`
2. Write properties directly into `style`: `<div style="...">`.

JavaScript can modify both classes and `style` properties.

We should always prefer CSS classes to `style`. The latter should only be used if classes "can't handle it".

For example, `style` is acceptable if we calculate coordinates of an element dynamically and want to set them from JavaScript, like this:

```js
let top = /* complex calculations */;
let left = /* complex calculations */;

elem.style.left = left; // e.g '123px', calculated at run-time
elem.style.top = top; // e.g '456px'
```

We can also set multiple styles for an element at once, using the `cssText` property. However, we should be careful with it, because it can both add styles to the existing ones and completely overwrite them with new ones:

```js
let top = /* complex calculations */;
let left = /* complex calculations */;

elem.style.cssText *!*=*/!* ` // total overwriting of elem styles, using =
  top: ${top};
  left: ${left};
`;

elem.style.cssText *!*+=*/!* ` // adding new styles to existing elem styles, using +=
  top: ${top};
  left: ${left};
`;

// if the element already has the styles we want to add (+=),
// they will be overwritten with the new ones.
```

For other cases, like making the text red, adding a background icon -- describe that in CSS and then add the class (JavaScript can do that). That's more flexible and easier to support.

## className and classList

Changing a class is one of the most often used actions in scripts.

In the ancient time, there was a limitation in JavaScript: a reserved word like `"class"` could not be an object property. That limitation does not exist now, but at that time it was impossible to have a `"class"` property, like `elem.class`.

So for classes the similar-looking property `"className"` was introduced: the `elem.className` corresponds to the `"class"` attribute.

For instance:

```html run
<body class="main page">
  <script>
    alert(document.body.className); // main page
  </script>
</body>
```

If we assign something to `elem.className`, it replaces the whole string of classes. Sometimes that's what we need, but often we want to add/remove a single class.

There's another property for that: `elem.classList`.

The `elem.classList` is a special object with methods to `add/remove/toggle` a single class.

For instance:

```html run
<body class="main page">
  <script>
*!*
    // add a class
    document.body.classList.add('article');
*/!*

    alert(document.body.className); // main page article
  </script>
</body>
```

So we can operate both on the full class string using `className` or on individual classes using `classList`. What we choose depends on our needs.

Methods of `classList`:

- `elem.classList.add/remove("class")` -- adds/removes the class.
- `elem.classList.toggle("class")` -- adds the class if it doesn't exist, otherwise removes it.
- `elem.classList.contains("class")` -- checks for the given class, returns `true/false`.

Besides, `classList` is iterable, so we can list all classes with `for..of`, like this:

```html run
<body class="main page">
  <script>
    for (let name of document.body.classList) {
      alert(name); // main, and then page
    }
  </script>
</body>
```

## Element style

The property `elem.style` is an object that corresponds to what's written in the `"style"` attribute.

Single-word properties are written in the same way, with a lowercase letter:

```js no-beautify
background  => elem.style.background
top         => elem.style.top
opacity     => elem.style.opacity
```

For multi-word property the [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) is used:

```js no-beautify
background-color  => elem.style.backgroundColor
z-index           => elem.style.zIndex
border-left-width => elem.style.borderLeftWidth
```

For instance:

```js run
document.body.style.backgroundColor = prompt('background color?', 'green');
```

````smart header="Prefixed properties"
Browser-prefixed properties like `-moz-border-radius`, `-webkit-border-radius` also follow the same rule: a dash means upper case.

For instance:

```js
button.style.MozBorderRadius = '5px';
button.style.WebkitBorderRadius = '5px';
```
````

## Resetting the style property

Sometimes we want to assign a style property, and later remove it.

For instance, to hide an element, we can set `elem.style.display = "none"`.

Then later we may want to remove the `style.display` as if it were not set. Instead of `delete elem.style.display` we should assign an empty string to it: `elem.style.display = ""`.

```js run
// if we run this code, the <body> will blink
document.body.style.display = "none"; // hide

setTimeout(() => document.body.style.display = "", 1000); // back to normal
```

If we set `style.display` to an empty string, then the browser applies CSS classes and its built-in styles normally, as if there were no such `style.display` property at all.

Also there is a special method for that, `elem.style.removeProperty('style property')`. So, We can remove a property like this:

```js run
document.body.style.background = 'red'; //set background to red

setTimeout(() => document.body.style.removeProperty('background'), 1000); // remove background after 1 second
```

## Mind the units

Don't forget to add CSS units to values.

For instance, we should not set `elem.style.top` to `10`, but rather to `10px`. Otherwise it wouldn't work:

```html run height=100
<body>
  <script>
  *!*
    // doesn't work!
    document.body.style.margin = 20;
    alert(document.body.style.margin); // '' (empty string, the assignment is ignored)
  */!*

    // now add the CSS unit (px) - and it works
    document.body.style.margin = '20px';
    alert(document.body.style.margin); // 20px

    alert(document.body.style.marginTop); // 20px
    alert(document.body.style.marginLeft); // 20px
  </script>
</body>
```

Please note: the browser "unpacks" the property `style.margin` in the last lines and infers `style.marginLeft` and `style.marginTop` from it.

## Computed styles: getComputedStyle

So, modifying a style is easy. But how to *read* it?

For instance, we want to know the size, margins, the color of an element. How to do it?

**The `style` property operates only on the value of the `"style"` attribute, without any CSS cascade.**

So we can't read anything that comes from CSS classes using `elem.style`.

For instance, here `style` doesn't see the margin:

```html run height=60 no-beautify
<head>
  <style> body { color: red; margin: 5px } </style>
</head>
<body>

  The red text
  <script>
*!*
    alert(document.body.style.color); // empty
    alert(document.body.style.marginTop); // empty
*/!*
  </script>
</body>
```

...But what if we need, say, to increase the margin by `20px`? We would want the current value of it.

There's another method for that: `getComputedStyle`.

The syntax is:

```js
getComputedStyle(element, [pseudo])
```

element
: Element to read the value for.

pseudo
: A pseudo-element if required, for instance `::before`. An empty string or no argument means the element itself.

The result is an object with styles, like `elem.style`, but now with respect to all CSS classes.

For instance:

```html run height=100
<head>
  <style> body { color: red; margin: 5px } </style>
</head>
<body>

  <script>
    let computedStyle = getComputedStyle(document.body);

    // now we can read the margin and the color from it

    alert( computedStyle.marginTop ); // 5px
    alert( computedStyle.color ); // rgb(255, 0, 0)
  </script>

</body>
```

```smart header="Computed and resolved values"
There are two concepts in [CSS](https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom/#resolved-values):

1. A *computed* style value is the value after all CSS rules and CSS inheritance is applied, as the result of the CSS cascade. It can look like `height:1em` or `font-size:125%`.
2. A *resolved* style value is the one finally applied to the element. Values like `1em` or `125%` are relative. The browser takes the computed value and makes all units fixed and absolute, for instance: `height:20px` or `font-size:16px`. For geometry properties resolved values may have a floating point, like `width:50.5px`.

A long time ago `getComputedStyle` was created to get computed values, but it turned out that resolved values are much more convenient, and the standard changed.

So nowadays `getComputedStyle` actually returns the resolved value of the property, usually in `px` for geometry.
```

````warn header="`getComputedStyle` requires the full property name"
We should always ask for the exact property that we want, like `paddingLeft` or `marginTop` or `borderTopWidth`. Otherwise the correct result is not guaranteed.

For instance, if there are properties `paddingLeft/paddingTop`, then what should we get for `getComputedStyle(elem).padding`? Nothing, or maybe a "generated" value from known paddings? There's no standard rule here.
````

```smart header="Styles applied to `:visited` links are hidden!"
Visited links may be colored using `:visited` CSS pseudoclass.

But `getComputedStyle` does not give access to that color, because otherwise an arbitrary page could find out whether the user visited a link by creating it on the page and checking the styles.

JavaScript may not see the styles applied by `:visited`. And also, there's a limitation in CSS that forbids applying geometry-changing styles in `:visited`. That's to guarantee that there's no side way for an evil page to test if a link was visited and hence to break the privacy.
```

## Summary

To manage classes, there are two DOM properties:

- `className` -- the string value, good to manage the whole set of classes.
- `classList` -- the object with methods `add/remove/toggle/contains`, good for individual classes.

To change the styles:

- The `style` property is an object with camelCased styles. Reading and writing to it has the same meaning as modifying individual properties in the `"style"` attribute. To see how to apply `important` and other rare stuff -- there's a list of methods at [MDN](mdn:api/CSSStyleDeclaration).

- The `style.cssText` property corresponds to the whole `"style"` attribute, the full string of styles.

To read the resolved styles (with respect to all classes, after all CSS is applied and final values are calculated):

- The `getComputedStyle(elem, [pseudo])` returns the style-like object with them. Read-only.
