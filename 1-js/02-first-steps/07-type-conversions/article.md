# Type Conversions

Most of the time, operators and functions automatically convert the values given to them to the right type.

For example, `alert` automatically converts any value to a string to show it. Mathematical operations convert values to numbers.

There are also cases when we need to explicitly convert a value to the expected type.

```smart header="Not talking about objects yet"
In this chapter, we won't cover objects. For now, we'll just be talking about primitives.

Later, after we learn about objects, in the chapter <info:object-toprimitive> we'll see how objects fit in.
```

## String Conversion

String conversion happens when we need the string form of a value.

For example, `alert(value)` does it to show the value.

We can also call the `String(value)` function to convert a value to a string:

```js run
let value = true;
alert(typeof value); // boolean

*!*
value = String(value); // now value is a string "true"
alert(typeof value); // string
*/!*
```

String conversion is mostly obvious. A `false` becomes `"false"`, `null` becomes `"null"`, etc.

## Numeric Conversion

Numeric conversion in mathematical functions and expressions happens automatically.

For example, when division `/` is applied to non-numbers:

```js run
alert( "6" / "2" ); // 3, strings are converted to numbers
```

We can use the `Number(value)` function to explicitly convert a `value` to a number:

```js run
let str = "123";
alert(typeof str); // string

let num = Number(str); // becomes a number 123

alert(typeof num); // number
```

Explicit conversion is usually required when we read a value from a string-based source like a text form but expect a number to be entered.

If the string is not a valid number, the result of such a conversion is `NaN`. For instance:

```js run
let age = Number("an arbitrary string instead of a number");

alert(age); // NaN, conversion failed
```

Numeric conversion rules:

| Value |  Becomes... |
|-------|-------------|
|`undefined`|`NaN`|
|`null`|`0`|
|<code>true&nbsp;and&nbsp;false</code> | `1` and `0` |
| `string` | Whitespaces (includes spaces, tabs `\t`, newlines `\n` etc.) from the start and end are removed. If the remaining string is empty, the result is `0`. Otherwise, the number is "read" from the string. An error gives `NaN`. |

Examples:

```js run
alert( Number("   123   ") ); // 123
alert( Number("123z") );      // NaN (error reading a number at "z")
alert( Number(true) );        // 1
alert( Number(false) );       // 0
```

Please note that `null` and `undefined` behave differently here: `null` becomes zero while `undefined` becomes `NaN`.

Most mathematical operators also perform such conversion, we'll see that in the next chapter.

## Boolean Conversion

Boolean conversion is the simplest one.

It happens in logical operations (later we'll meet condition tests and other similar things) but can also be performed explicitly with a call to `Boolean(value)`.

The conversion rule:

- Everything , except `0` ,`""` (empty string , not even a space between quotes) , `null` ,`undefined` and `NaN` becomes `true` , these five are converted to `false`.


For instance:

```js run
alert( Boolean(1) ); // true
alert( Boolean(0) ); // false

alert( Boolean("hello") ); // true
alert( Boolean("") ); // false
```

````warn header="Please note: the string with zero `\"0\"` is `true`"
Some languages (namely PHP) treat `"0"` as `false`. But in JavaScript, a non-empty string is always `true`.

```js run
alert( Boolean("0") ); // true
alert( Boolean(" ") ); // spaces, also true (any non-empty string is true)
```
````

## Summary

The three most widely used type conversions are to string, to number, and to boolean.

**`String Conversion`** -- Occurs when we output something. Can be performed with `String(value)`. The conversion to string is usually obvious for primitive values.

**`Numeric Conversion`** -- Occurs in math operations. Can be performed with `Number(value)`.

The conversion follows the rules:

| Value |  Becomes... |
|-------|-------------|
|`undefined`|`NaN`|
|`null`|`0`|
|<code>true&nbsp;/&nbsp;false</code> | `1 / 0` |
| `string` | The string is read "as is", whitespaces (includes spaces, tabs `\t`, newlines `\n` etc.) from both sides are ignored. An empty string becomes `0`. An error gives `NaN`. |

**`Boolean Conversion`** -- Occurs in logical operations. Can be performed with `Boolean(value)`.

Follows the rules:

| Value |  Becomes... |
|-------|-------------|
|`0`, `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`, `""` |`false`|
|any other value| `true` |


Most of these rules are easy to understand and memorize. The notable exceptions where people usually make mistakes are:

- `undefined` is `NaN` as a number, not `0`.
- `"0"` and space-only strings like `"   "` are true as a boolean.

Objects aren't covered here. We'll return to them later in the chapter <info:object-toprimitive> that is devoted exclusively to objects after we learn more basic things about JavaScript.
