# Logical operators

There are seven logical operators in JavaScript:

- `||` (OR)
  - `||=` (Logical OR assignment operator)
- `&&` (AND)
  - `&&=` (Logical AND assignment operator)
- `!` (NOT)
- `??` (Nullish coalescing operator)
  - `??=` (Nullish coalescing assignment operator)

Here we cover the first five, the operators `??` and `??=` will be in the next article.

Although they are called "logical", they can be applied to values of any type, not only boolean. Their result can also be of any type.

Let's see the details.

## || (OR)

The "OR" operator is represented with two vertical line symbols:

```js
result = a || b;
```

In classical programming, the logical OR is meant to manipulate boolean values only. If any of its arguments are `true`, it returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`.

In JavaScript, the operator is a little bit trickier and more powerful. But first, let's see what happens with boolean values.

There are four possible logical combinations:

```js run
alert( true || true );   // true
alert( false || true );  // true
alert( true || false );  // true
alert( false || false ); // false
```

As we can see, the result is always `true` except for the case when both operands are `false`.

If an operand is not a boolean, it's converted to a boolean for the evaluation.

For instance, the number `1` is treated as `true`, the number `0` as `false`:

```js run
if (1 || 0) { // works just like if( true || false )
  alert( 'truthy!' );
}
```

Most of the time, OR `||` is used in an `if` statement to test if *any* of the given conditions is `true`.

For example:

```js run
let hour = 9;

*!*
if (hour < 10 || hour > 18) {
*/!*
  alert( 'The office is closed.' );
}
```

We can pass more conditions:

```js run
let hour = 12;
let isWeekend = true;

if (hour < 10 || hour > 18 || isWeekend) {
  alert( 'The office is closed.' ); // it is the weekend
}
```

### OR "||" finds the first truthy value [#or-finds-the-first-truthy-value]

The logic described above is somewhat classical. Now, let's bring in the "extra" features of JavaScript.

The extended algorithm works as follows.

Given multiple OR'ed values:

```js
result = value1 || value2 || value3;
```

The OR `||` operator does the following:

- Evaluates operands from left to right.
- For each operand, converts it to boolean. If the result is `true`, stops and returns the original value of that operand.
- If all operands have been evaluated (i.e. all were `false`), returns the last operand.

A value is returned in its original form, without the conversion.

In other words, a chain of OR `||` returns the first truthy value or the last one if no truthy value is found.

For instance:

```js run
alert( 1 || 0 ); // 1 (1 is truthy)

alert( null || 1 ); // 1 (1 is the first truthy value)
alert( null || 0 || 1 ); // 1 (the first truthy value)

alert( undefined || null || 0 ); // 0 (all falsy, returns the last value)
```

This leads to some interesting usage compared to a "pure, classical, boolean-only OR".

1. **Getting the first truthy value from a list of variables or expressions.**

    For instance, we have `firstName`, `lastName` and `nickName` variables, all optional (i.e. can be undefined or have falsy values).

    Let's use OR `||` to choose the one that has the data and show it (or `"Anonymous"` if nothing set):

    ```js run
    let firstName = "";
    let lastName = "";
    let nickName = "SuperCoder";

    *!*
    alert( firstName || lastName || nickName || "Anonymous"); // SuperCoder
    */!*
    ```

    If all variables were falsy, `"Anonymous"` would show up.

2. **Short-circuit evaluation.**

    Another feature of OR `||` operator is the so-called "short-circuit" evaluation.

    It means that `||` processes its arguments until the first truthy value is reached, and then the value is returned immediately, without even touching the other argument.

    The importance of this feature becomes obvious if an operand isn't just a value, but an expression with a side effect, such as a variable assignment or a function call.

    In the example below, only the second message is printed:

    ```js run no-beautify
    *!*true*/!* || alert("not printed");
    *!*false*/!* || alert("printed");
    ```

    In the first line, the OR `||` operator stops the evaluation immediately upon seeing `true`, so the `alert` isn't run.

    Sometimes, people use this feature to execute commands only if the condition on the left part is falsy.

## ||= (Logical OR assignment)

[recent browser="new"]

The logical OR assignment operator `||=` is written as a regular OR `||` with the addition of the assignment symbol `=`. This notation is not accidental, since the result of this operator depends directly on the behavior of the already known `||`.

Syntax:

```js
a ||= b
```

The `||=` operator takes two operands and performs the following actions:

- Evaluates operands from left to right.
- Converts `a` to a boolean value.
- If `a` is falsy, assigns `a` the value of `b`.

The concept of the `||=` operator is the "short-circuit" evaluation, the principle of which we analyzed earlier.

Now let's rewrite `a ||= b` under the form of "short-circuit" evaluation:

```js
a || (a = b);
```

We already know that OR `||` returns the *first truthy value*, so if `a` is such, the evaluation will not reach the right-hand side of the expression.

Here is an example with an obvious usage of the `||=` operator:

```js run
let johnHasCar = false;

johnHasCar ||= "John doesn't have a car!"; // same as false || (johnHasCar = "...")

alert( johnHasCar ); // "John doesn't have a car!"
```

...And this is where the conversion to a boolean value takes place:

```js run
let manufacturer = ""; // ||= operator will convert the empty string "" to the boolean value (false)

manufacturer ||= "Unknown manufacturer"; // same as false || (manufacturer = "...")

alert( manufacturer ); // "Unknown manufacturer"
```

The logical OR assignment operator `||=` is a "[syntactic sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar)" added to the language as a shorter form of writing `if` assignment statements.

We can rewrite the above examples using the regular `if`:

```js run
let johnHasCar = false;

if (johnHasCar == false) {
  johnHasCar = "John doesn't have a car!";
}

alert(johnHasCar); // "John doesn't have a car!"

let manufacturer = "";

if (manufacturer == false) {
  manufacturer = "Unknown manufacturer";
}

alert(manufacturer); // "Unknown manufacturer"
```

## && (AND)

The AND operator is represented with two ampersands `&&`:

```js
result = a && b;
```

In classical programming, AND returns `true` if both operands are truthy and `false` otherwise:

```js run
alert( true && true );   // true
alert( false && true );  // false
alert( true && false );  // false
alert( false && false ); // false
```

An example with `if`:

```js run
let hour = 12;
let minute = 30;

if (hour == 12 && minute == 30) {
  alert( 'The time is 12:30' );
}
```

Just as with OR, any value is allowed as an operand of AND:

```js run
if (1 && 0) { // evaluated as true && false
  alert( "won't work, because the result is falsy" );
}
```


### AND "&&" finds the first falsy value

Given multiple AND'ed values:

```js
result = value1 && value2 && value3;
```

The AND `&&` operator does the following:

- Evaluates operands from left to right.
- For each operand, converts it to a boolean. If the result is `false`, stops and returns the original value of that operand.
- If all operands have been evaluated (i.e. all were truthy), returns the last operand.

In other words, AND returns the first falsy value or the last value if none were found.

The rules above are similar to OR. The difference is that AND returns the first *falsy* value while OR returns the first *truthy* one.

Examples:

```js run
// if the first operand is truthy,
// AND returns the second operand:
alert( 1 && 0 ); // 0
alert( 1 && 5 ); // 5

// if the first operand is falsy,
// AND returns it. The second operand is ignored
alert( null && 5 ); // null
alert( 0 && "no matter what" ); // 0
```

We can also pass several values in a row. See how the first falsy one is returned:

```js run
alert( 1 && 2 && null && 3 ); // null
```

When all values are truthy, the last value is returned:

```js run
alert( 1 && 2 && 3 ); // 3, the last one
```

````smart header="Precedence of AND `&&` is higher than OR `||`"
The precedence of AND `&&` operator is higher than OR `||`.

So the code `a && b || c && d` is essentially the same as if the `&&` expressions were in parentheses: `(a && b) || (c && d)`.
````

````warn header="Don't replace `if` with `||` or `&&`"
Sometimes, people use the AND `&&` operator as a "shorter way to write `if`".

For instance:

```js run
let x = 1;

(x > 0) && alert( 'Greater than zero!' );
```

The action in the right part of `&&` would execute only if the evaluation reaches it. That is, only if `(x > 0)` is true.

So we basically have an analogue for:

```js run
let x = 1;

if (x > 0) alert( 'Greater than zero!' );
```

Although, the variant with `&&` appears shorter, `if` is more obvious and tends to be a little bit more readable. So we recommend using every construct for its purpose: use `if` if we want `if` and use `&&` if we want AND.

## &&= (Logical AND assignment)

[recent browser="new"]

The logical AND assignment operator `&&=` is written as two ampersands `&&` and the assignment symbol `=`.

Syntax:

```js
a &&= b
```

The principle of `&&=` is almost the same as that of the logical OR assignment operator `||=`. The only difference is that `&&=` will assign `a` to the value of `b` only if `a` is *truthy*.

The concept of the logical AND assignment operator `&&=` is also based on "short-circuit" evaluation:

```js
a && (a = b);
```

Here's an example:

```js run
let greeting = "Hello"; // the string is non-empty, so it will be converted to the boolean value (true) by the &&= operator.

greeting &&= greeting + ", user!"; // same as true && (greeting = greeting + "...")

alert( greeting ) // "Hello, user!"
```

Since the logical AND assignment operator `&&=` as well as `||=` is "syntactic sugar", we can easily rewrite the example above using the familiar `if`:

```js run
let greeting = "Hello";

if (greeting) {
  greeting = greeting + ", user!"
}

alert( greeting ) // "Hello, user!"
```

In practice, unlike `||=`, the `&&=` operator is used quite rarely -- usually in combination with more complex language features, about which we will talk later. Finding a context for using this operator is a challenging task.

## ! (NOT)

The boolean NOT operator is represented with an exclamation sign `!`.

The syntax is pretty simple:

```js
result = !value;
```

The operator accepts a single argument and does the following:

1. Converts the operand to boolean type: `true/false`.
2. Returns the inverse value.

For instance:

```js run
alert( !true ); // false
alert( !0 ); // true
```

A double NOT `!!` is sometimes used for converting a value to boolean type:

```js run
alert( !!"non-empty string" ); // true
alert( !!null ); // false
```

That is, the first NOT converts the value to boolean and returns the inverse, and the second NOT inverses it again. In the end, we have a plain value-to-boolean conversion.

There's a little more verbose way to do the same thing -- a built-in `Boolean` function:

```js run
alert( Boolean("non-empty string") ); // true
alert( Boolean(null) ); // false
```

The precedence of NOT `!` is the highest of all logical operators, so it always executes first, before `&&` or `||`.
