The answer: `30`.

```js run
let value = NaN;

value &&= 10;
value ||= 20;
value &&= 30;
value ||= 40;

alert(value);
```

The order of execution of this code is:
1. `value &&= 10`
   - `value=NaN`
   - `NaN` is converted to the boolean `false`
   - `value` is falsy, so assignment *doesn't* work
2. `value ||= 20`
   - `value=NaN`
   - `NaN` is converted to the boolean `false`
   - `value` is falsy, so assignment *works* 
3. `value &&= 30`
   - `value=20`
   - `20` is converted to the boolean `true`
   - `value` is truthy, so assignment *works*
4. `value ||= 40`
   - `value=30`
   - `30` is converted to the boolean `true`
   - `value` is truthy, so assignment *doesn't* work
