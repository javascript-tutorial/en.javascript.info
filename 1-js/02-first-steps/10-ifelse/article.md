# Conditional branching: if, '?'

Sometimes, we need to perform different actions based on different conditions.

To do that, we can use the `if` statement and the conditional operator `?`, that's also called a "question mark" operator.

## The "if" statement

The `if(...)` statement evaluates the condition in parentheses to a Boolean value and, if the result is `true`, executes a block of code.

For example:

```js run
let year = prompt('In which year was ECMAScript-2015 specification published?', '');

*!*
if (year == 2015) alert( 'You are right!' );
*/!*
```

In the example above, the condition is a simple equality check (`year == 2015`), but it can be much more complex.

If we want to execute more than one statement, we have to wrap our code block inside curly braces:

```js
if (year == 2015) {
  alert( "That's correct!" );
  alert( "You're so smart!" );
}
```

We recommend wrapping your code block with curly braces `{}` every time you use an `if` statement, even if there is only one statement to execute. Doing so improves readability.

## Boolean conversion

Let's recall the conversion rules from the chapter <info:type-conversions>:

- The number `0`, empty string `""`, `null`, `undefined`, and `NaN` all become `false`.hence,they are called "falsy" values.
- All Other values become `true`, so they are called "truthy".

So, the code under this condition would never execute:

```js
if (0) { // 0 is falsy
  ...
}
```

...and inside this condition -- it always will:

```js
if (1) { // 1 is truthy
  ...
}
```

We can also pass a pre-evaluated boolean value to `if`, like this:

```js
let cond = (year == 2015); // equality evaluates to true or false

if (cond) {
  ...
}
```

## The "else" clause

The `if` statement may contain an optional `else` block. It executes when the condition is falsy.

For example:
```js run
let year = prompt('In which year was the ECMAScript-2015 specification published?', '');

if (year == 2015) {
  alert( 'You guessed it right!' );
} else {
  alert( 'How can you be so wrong?' ); // any value except 2015
}
```

## The "if-else" ladder

Sometimes, we'd like to test several variants of a condition. The `else if` clause lets us do that.

For example:

```js run
let year = prompt('In which year was the ECMAScript-2015 specification published?', '');

if (year < 2015) {
  alert( 'Too early...' );
} else if (year > 2015) {
  alert( 'Too late' );
} else {
  alert( 'Exactly!' );
}
```

In the code above, JavaScript first checks `year < 2015`. If that is falsy, it goes to the next condition `year > 2015`. If that is also falsy, it shows the last `alert`.

There can be more `else if` blocks. The final `else` is optional.

## Conditional / ternary operator '?'
 
Sometimes, we need to assign a variable depending on a condition.

For instance:

```js run no-beautify
let accessAllowed;
let age = prompt('How old are you?', '');

*!*
if (age > 18) {
  accessAllowed = true;
} else {
  accessAllowed = false;
}
*/!*

alert(accessAllowed);
```

The so-called "conditional" or "question mark" operator lets us do that in a shorter and simpler way.

The operator is represented by `?`. Often it's called "ternary operator", because it has three operands. It is actually the one and only operator in JavaScript which has three operands.

The syntax is:
```js
let result = condition ? value1 : value2;
```

The `condition` is evaluated: if it's truthy then `value1` is returned, otherwise  `value2` is returned.

For example:

```js
let accessAllowed = (age > 18) ? true : false;
```

Technically, we can omit the parentheses around `age > 18`. The conditional  operator has a low precedence, so it executes after the comparison `>`.

This example will do the same thing as the previous one:

```js
// the comparison operator "age > 18" executes first anyway
// (no need to wrap it into parentheses)
let accessAllowed = age > 18 ? true : false;
```

But parentheses make the code more readable, so we recommend using them.

````smart
In the example above, you can avoid using the conditional  operator because the comparison itself returns `true/false`:

```js
// the same
let accessAllowed = age > 18;
```
````

## Using multiple ' ? '

A sequence of conditional operators `?` can return a value that depends on more than one condition.

For instance:
```js run
let age = prompt('age?', 18);

let message = (age < 3) ? 'Hi, baby!' :
                        (age < 18) ? 'Hello!' :
                        (age < 100) ? 'Greetings!' :
                        'Please tell me your Secret!';

alert( message );
```

It may be difficult at first to grasp what's going on. But after a closer look, we can see that it's just an ordinary sequence of tests:

1. The first question mark checks whether `age < 3`.
2. If true -- it returns `'Hi, baby!'`. Otherwise, it continues to the expression after the colon `:`, checking `age < 18`.
3. If that's true -- it returns `'Hello!'`. Otherwise, it continues to the expression after the next colon `:`, checking `age < 100`.
4. If that's true -- it returns `'Greetings!'`. Otherwise, it continues to the expression after the last colon `:`, returning `'Please tell me your Secret!'`.

Here's how this looks using `if..else`:

```js
if (age < 3) {
  message = 'Hi, baby!';
} else if (age < 18) {
  message = 'Hello!';
} else if (age < 100) {
  message = 'Greetings!';
} else {
  message = 'Please tell me your Secret!';
}
```

## Non-traditional use of '?'

Sometimes the conditional operator `?` is used as a replacement for `if`:

```js run no-beautify
let company = prompt('Which company created JavaScript?', '');

*!*
(company == 'Netscape') ?
   alert('Right!') : alert('Wrong.');
*/!*
```

Depending on the condition `company == 'Netscape'`, either the first or the second expression after the `?` gets executed and shows an alert.

We don't assign a result to a variable here. Instead, we execute different code depending on the condition.

**It's not recommended to use the conditional operator  operator in this way.**

The notation is shorter than the equivalent `if` statement, which appeals to some programmers. But it is less readable.

Here is the same code using `if` for comparison:

```js run no-beautify
let company = prompt('Which company created JavaScript?', '');

*!*
if (company == 'Netscape') {
  alert('Right!');
} else {
  alert('Wrong.');
}
*/!*
```

Our eyes scan the code vertically. Code blocks which span several lines are easier to understand than a long, horizontal instruction set.

The purpose of the conditional operator `?` is to return one value or another depending on its condition. Please use it for exactly that. Use `if..else` when you need to execute a deeply nested code.

Note :- Sometimes ternary operator is also represented using `? :`.
