# Object to primitive conversion

What happens when objects are added `obj1 + obj2`, subtracted `obj1 - obj2` or printed using `alert(obj)`?

JavaScript doesn't allow you to customize how operators work on objects. Unlike some other programming languages, such as Ruby or C++, we can't implement a special object method to handle addition (or other operators).

In case of such operations, objects are auto-converted to primitives, and then the operation is carried out over these primitives and results in a primitive value.

That's an important limitation: the result of `obj1 + obj2` (or another math operation) can't be another object!

E.g. we can't make objects representing vectors or matrices (or achievements or whatever), add them and expect a "summed" object as the result. Such architectural feats are automatically "off the board".

So, because we can't technically do much here, there's no maths with objects in real projects. When it happens, with rare exceptions, it's because of a coding mistake.

In this chapter we'll cover how an object converts to primitive and how to customize it.

We have two purposes:

1. It will allow us to understand what's going on in case of coding mistakes, when such an operation happened accidentally.
2. There are exceptions, where such operations are possible and look good. E.g. subtracting or comparing dates (`Date` objects). We'll come across them later.

## Conversion rules

In the chapter <info:type-conversions> we've seen the rules for numeric, string and boolean conversions of primitives. But we left a gap for objects. Now, as we know about methods and symbols it becomes possible to fill it.

1. There's no conversion to boolean. All objects are `true` in a boolean context, as simple as that. There exist only numeric and string conversions.
2. The numeric conversion happens when we subtract objects or apply mathematical functions. For instance, `Date` objects (to be covered in the chapter <info:date>) can be subtracted, and the result of `date1 - date2` is the time difference between two dates.
3. As for the string conversion -- it usually happens when we output an object with `alert(obj)` and in similar contexts.

We can implement string and numeric conversion by ourselves, using special object methods.

Now let's get into technical details, because it's the only way to cover the topic in-depth.

## Hints

How does JavaScript decide which conversion to apply?

There are three variants of type conversion, that happen in various situations. They're called "hints", as described in the [specification](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-toprimitive):

`"string"`
: For an object-to-string conversion, when we're doing an operation on an object that expects a string, like `alert`:

    ```js
    // output
    alert(obj);

    // using object as a property key
    anotherObj[obj] = 123;
    ```

`"number"`
: For an object-to-number conversion, like when we're doing maths:

    ```js
    // explicit conversion
    let num = Number(obj);

    // maths (except binary plus)
    let n = +obj; // unary plus
    let delta = date1 - date2;

    // less/greater comparison
    let greater = user1 > user2;
    ```

    Most built-in mathematical functions also include such conversion.

`"default"`
: Occurs in rare cases when the operator is "not sure" what type to expect.

    For instance, binary plus `+` can work both with strings (concatenates them) and numbers (adds them). So if a binary plus gets an object as an argument, it uses the `"default"` hint to convert it.

    Also, if an object is compared using `==` with a string, number or a symbol, it's also unclear which conversion should be done, so the `"default"` hint is used.

    ```js
    // binary plus uses the "default" hint
    let total = obj1 + obj2;

    // obj == number uses the "default" hint
    if (user == 1) { ... };
    ```

    The greater and less comparison operators, such as `<` `>`, can work with both strings and numbers too. Still, they use the `"number"` hint, not `"default"`. That's for historical reasons.

In practice though, things are a bit simpler.

All built-in objects except for one case (`Date` object, we'll learn it later) implement `"default"` conversion the same way as `"number"`. And we probably should do the same.

Still, it's important to know about all 3 hints, soon we'll see why.

**To do the conversion, JavaScript tries to find and call three object methods:**

1. Call `obj[Symbol.toPrimitive](hint)` - the method with the symbolic key `Symbol.toPrimitive` (system symbol), if such method exists,
2. Otherwise if hint is `"string"`
    - try calling `obj.toString()` or `obj.valueOf()`, whatever exists.
3. Otherwise if hint is `"number"` or `"default"`
    - try calling `obj.valueOf()` or `obj.toString()`, whatever exists.

## Symbol.toPrimitive

Let's start from the first method. There's a built-in symbol named `Symbol.toPrimitive` that should be used to name the conversion method, like this:

```js
obj[Symbol.toPrimitive] = function(hint) {
  // here goes the code to convert this object to a primitive
  // it must return a primitive value
  // hint = one of "string", "number", "default"
};
```

If the method `Symbol.toPrimitive` exists, it's used for all hints, and no more methods are needed.

For instance, here `user` object implements it:

```js run
let user = {
  name: "John",
  money: 1000,

  [Symbol.toPrimitive](hint) {
    alert(`hint: ${hint}`);
    return hint == "string" ? `{name: "${this.name}"}` : this.money;
  }
};

// conversions demo:
alert(user); // hint: string -> {name: "John"}
alert(+user); // hint: number -> 1000
alert(user + 500); // hint: default -> 1500
```

As we can see from the code, `user` becomes a self-descriptive string or a money amount, depending on the conversion. The single method `user[Symbol.toPrimitive]` handles all conversion cases.

## toString/valueOf

If there's no `Symbol.toPrimitive` then JavaScript tries to find methods `toString` and `valueOf`:

- For the `"string"` hint: call `toString` method, and if it doesn't exist or if it returns an object instead of a primitive value, then call `valueOf` (so `toString` has the priority for string conversions).
- For other hints: call `valueOf`, and if it doesn't exist or if it returns an object instead of a primitive value, then call `toString` (so `valueOf` has the priority for maths).

Methods `toString` and `valueOf` come from ancient times. They are not symbols (symbols did not exist that long ago), but rather "regular" string-named methods. They provide an alternative "old-style" way to implement the conversion.

These methods must return a primitive value. If `toString` or `valueOf` returns an object, then it's ignored (same as if there were no method).

By default, a plain object has following `toString` and `valueOf` methods:

- The `toString` method returns a string `"[object Object]"`.
- The `valueOf` method returns the object itself.

Here's the demo:

```js run
let user = {name: "John"};

alert(user); // [object Object]
alert(user.valueOf() === user); // true
```

So if we try to use an object as a string, like in an `alert` or so, then by default we see `[object Object]`.

The default `valueOf` is mentioned here only for the sake of completeness, to avoid any confusion. As you can see, it returns the object itself, and so is ignored. Don't ask me why, that's for historical reasons. So we can assume it doesn't exist.

Let's implement these methods to customize the conversion.

For instance, here `user` does the same as above using a combination of `toString` and `valueOf` instead of `Symbol.toPrimitive`:

```js run
let user = {
  name: "John",
  money: 1000,

  // for hint="string"
  toString() {
    return `{name: "${this.name}"}`;
  },

  // for hint="number" or "default"
  valueOf() {
    return this.money;
  }

};

alert(user); // toString -> {name: "John"}
alert(+user); // valueOf -> 1000
alert(user + 500); // valueOf -> 1500
```

As we can see, the behavior is the same as the previous example with `Symbol.toPrimitive`.

Often we want a single "catch-all" place to handle all primitive conversions. In this case, we can implement `toString` only, like this:

```js run
let user = {
  name: "John",

  toString() {
    return this.name;
  }
};

alert(user); // toString -> John
alert(user + 500); // toString -> John500
```

In the absence of `Symbol.toPrimitive` and `valueOf`, `toString` will handle all primitive conversions.

### A conversion can return any primitive type

The important thing to know about all primitive-conversion methods is that they do not necessarily return the "hinted" primitive.

There is no control whether `toString` returns exactly a string, or whether `Symbol.toPrimitive` method returns a number for the hint `"number"`.

The only mandatory thing: these methods must return a primitive, not an object.

```smart header="Historical notes"
For historical reasons, if `toString` or `valueOf` returns an object, there's no error, but such value is ignored (like if the method didn't exist). That's because in ancient times there was no good "error" concept in JavaScript.

In contrast, `Symbol.toPrimitive` is stricter, it *must* return a primitive, otherwise there will be an error.
```

## Further conversions

As we know already, many operators and functions perform type conversions, e.g. multiplication `*` converts operands to numbers.

If we pass an object as an argument, then there are two stages of calculations:
1. The object is converted to a primitive (using the rules described above).
2. If necessary for further calculations, the resulting primitive is also converted.

For instance:

```js run
let obj = {
  // toString handles all conversions in the absence of other methods
  toString() {
    return "2";
  }
};

alert(obj * 2); // 4, object converted to primitive "2", then multiplication made it a number
```

1. The multiplication `obj * 2` first converts the object to primitive (that's a string `"2"`).
2. Then `"2" * 2` becomes `2 * 2` (the string is converted to number).

Binary plus will concatenate strings in the same situation, as it gladly accepts a string:

```js run
let obj = {
  toString() {
    return "2";
  }
};

alert(obj + 2); // 22 ("2" + 2), conversion to primitive returned a string => concatenation
```

## Summary

The object-to-primitive conversion is called automatically by many built-in functions and operators that expect a primitive as a value.

There are 3 types (hints) of it:
- `"string"` (for `alert` and other operations that need a string)
- `"number"` (for maths)
- `"default"` (few operators, usually objects implement it the same way as `"number"`)

The specification describes explicitly which operator uses which hint.

The conversion algorithm is:

1. Call `obj[Symbol.toPrimitive](hint)` if the method exists,
2. Otherwise if hint is `"string"`
    - try calling `obj.toString()` or `obj.valueOf()`, whatever exists.
3. Otherwise if hint is `"number"` or `"default"`
    - try calling `obj.valueOf()` or `obj.toString()`, whatever exists.

All these methods must return a primitive to work (if defined).

In practice, it's often enough to implement only `obj.toString()` as a "catch-all" method for string conversions that should return a "human-readable" representation of an object, for logging or debugging purposes.
