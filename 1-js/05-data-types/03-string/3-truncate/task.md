# Truncate the text

Create a function `truncate(str, maxlength)` that checks the length of the `str` and, if it exceeds `maxlength` -- replaces the end of `str` with the ellipsis character `"…"`, to make its length equal to `maxlength`.

The result of the function should be the truncated (if needed) string.

For instance:

```js
truncate("What I'd like to tell on this topic is:", 20) == "What I'd like to te…"

truncate("Hi everyone!", 20) == "Hi everyone!"
```
