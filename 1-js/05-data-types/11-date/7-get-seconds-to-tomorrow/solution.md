To get the number of milliseconds till tomorrow, we can subtract the current date from "tomorrow 00:00:00".

First, we generate that "tomorrow", and then do it:

```js run
function getSecondsToTomorrow() {
  let now = new Date();

  // tomorrow date
  let tomorrow = new Date(now.getFullYear(), now.getMonth(), *!*now.getDate()+1*/!*);

  let diff = tomorrow - now; // difference in ms
  return Math.round(diff / 1000); // convert to seconds
}
```

Alternative solution:

```js run
function getSecondsToTomorrow() {
  let now = new Date();
  let hour = now.getHours();
  let minutes = now.getMinutes();
  let seconds = now.getSeconds();
  let totalSecondsToday = (hour * 60 + minutes) * 60 + seconds;
  let totalSecondsInADay = 86400;

  return totalSecondsInADay - totalSecondsToday;
}
```

Please note that many countries have Daylight Savings Time (DST), so there may be days with 23 or 25 hours. We may want to treat such days separately.
