# The simple but wrong solution

The simplest, but wrong solution would be to generate a value from `min` to `max` and round it:

```js run
function randomInteger(min, max) {
  let rand = min + Math.random() * (max - min); 
  return Math.round(rand);
}

alert( randomInteger(1, 3) );
```

The function works, but it is incorrect. The probability to get edge values `min` and `max` is two times less than any other.

If you run the example above many times, you would easily see that `2` appears the most often.

That happens because `Math.round()` gets random numbers from the interval `1..3` and rounds them as follows:

```js no-beautify
values from 1    ... to 1.4999999999  become 1
values from 1.5  ... to 2.4999999999  become 2
values from 2.5  ... to 2.9999999999  become 3
```

Now we can clearly see that `1` gets twice less values than `2`. And the same with `3`.

# The correct solution

There are many correct solutions to the task. One of them is to use `Math.floor` for a random number from `min` to `max+1`:
```js run
*!*
function randomInteger(min, max) {
  // here rand is from min to (max+1)
  let rand = min + Math.random() * (max + 1 - min);
  return Math.floor(rand);
}
*/!*

alert( randomInteger(1, 3) );
```

Now all intervals are mapped this way:

```js no-beautify
values from 1  ... to 1.9999999999  become 1
values from 2  ... to 2.9999999999  become 2
values from 3  ... to 3.9999999999  become 3
```

All intervals have the same length, making the final distribution uniform.
