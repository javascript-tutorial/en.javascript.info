# Which variables are available?

The function `makeWorker` below makes another function and returns it. That new function can be called from somewhere else.

Will the nested function have access to the outer variables from its creation place, or the invocation place, or both?

```js
function makeWorker() {
  let name = "Pete";

  return function() {
    alert(name);
  };
}

let name = "John";

// create a function
let work = makeWorker();

// call it
work(); // what will it show?
```

Which value it will show? "Pete" or "John"?
