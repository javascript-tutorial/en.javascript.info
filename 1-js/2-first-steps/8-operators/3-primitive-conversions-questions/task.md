# Type conversions

[importance 5]

Let's recap type conversions in the context of operators.

What will be the result for expressions?

```js
//+ no-beautify
"" + 1 + 0 
"" - 1 + 0
true + false
6 / "3"
"2" * "3"
4 + 5 + "px"
"$" + 4 + 5  
"4" - 2  
"4px" - 2 
7 / 0  
"  -9\n" + 5 
"  -9\n" - 5
null + 1
undefined + 1
```
