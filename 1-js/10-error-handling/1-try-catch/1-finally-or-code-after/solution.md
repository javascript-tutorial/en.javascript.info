The difference becomes obvious when we look at the code inside a function.

The behavior is different if there's a "jump out" of `try...catch`.

For instance, when there's a `return` inside `try...catch`. The `finally` clause works in case of *any* exit from `try...catch`, even via the `return` statement: right after `try...catch` is done, but before the calling code gets the control.

```js run
function f() {
  try {
    alert('start');
*!*
    return "result";
*/!*
  } catch (err) {
    /// ...
  } finally {
    alert('cleanup!');
  }
}

f(); // cleanup!
```

...Or when there's a `throw`, like here:

```js run
function f() {
  try {
    alert('start');
    throw new Error("an error");
  } catch (err) {
    // ...
    if("can't handle the error") {
*!*
      throw err;
*/!*
    }

  } finally {
    alert('cleanup!')
  }
}

f(); // cleanup!
```

It's `finally` that guarantees the cleanup here. If we just put the code at the end of `f`, it wouldn't run in these situations.
