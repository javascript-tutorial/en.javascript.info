# Manuals and specifications

This book is a *tutorial* to help you gradually learn the language. Once you're familiar with the basics, you'll need other resources.

## Specification

The ECMA-262 specification defines the JavaScript language. The formal document is not for everyday use as it's difficult to understand at first. If you need the most trustworthy source of information about the language details, the specification is the right place. A new specification version is released every year. 

- [ECMA-262 specification](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm) contains the most in-depth, detailed and formalized information.
- [Latest draft](https://tc39.es/ecma262/) is discussed and reviewed between specification releases.
- [Proposals for bleeding-edge features](https://github.com/tc39/proposals), including those that are "almost standard" (so-called "stage 3").
- [Part 2 - Browser: Document, Events, Interfaces](info:browser-environment) covers other specifications if you're developing for the browser.

## Manuals

- [MDN (Mozilla) JavaScript Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference) is the main manual with examples and in-depth information about individual language functions, methods etc.

It's often best to Google "MDN [term]" in your query, e.g. <https://google.com/search?q=MDN+parseInt> to search for the `parseInt` function.

## Compatibility tables

JavaScript is a developing language, new features get added regularly.

To see browser and engine support, see:

- <https://caniuse.com> - per-feature tables of support, e.g. to see which engines support modern cryptography functions: <https://caniuse.com/#feat=cryptography>.
- <https://kangax.github.io/compat-table> - a table with language features and engines that support those or don't support.

All these resources are useful in real-life development, as they contain valuable information about language details, their support, etc.

Please remember them (or this page) when you need in-depth information about a particular feature.
