# An Introduction to JavaScript

*JavaScript* was initially created to "make web pages alive".

The programs in this language are called *scripts*. They can be written right in a web page's HTML and run automatically as the page loads.

```smart header="Why is it called <u>Java</u>Script?"
When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: "LiveScript". But another language named Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as a "younger brother" of Java would help.

...As it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language with its own specification called [ECMAScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript), and now it has no relation to Java at all.
```

Historically, web development is the main field of application for JavaScript.

This is because of its wide adoption and uniquely tight integration with HTML/CSS.

**Nowadays though, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or on any device which supports a JavaScript engine.**

A "JavaScript engine", sometimes also called a "JavaScript virtual machine" – is a piece of software which can be embedded in a browser or another bigger program and can execute JavaScript.

Different engines have different "codenames". For example:

- [V8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)) -- in Chrome, Opera and Edge.
- [SpiderMonkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpiderMonkey) -- in Firefox.
- ...There are other codenames like "JavaScriptCore", "Nitro" and "SquirrelFish" for Safari, etc.

The terms above are good to remember because they are often mentioned. For instance, if "a feature X is supported by V8", then it probably works in Chrome, Opera and Edge browsers.

As mentioned, engines can execute not only in the browser. For instance, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) allows to execute JavaScript code without any browser at all. It's based on V8 engine. One can install it locally on your computer and write JavaScript code to assist in daily tasks, file management, etc.
