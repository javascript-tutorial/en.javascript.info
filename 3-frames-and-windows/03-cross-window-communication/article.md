# Cross-window communication

The "Same Origin" (same site) policy limits access of windows and frames to each other.

The idea is that if a user has two pages open: one from `john-smith.com`, and another one is `gmail.com`, then they wouldn't want a script from `john-smith.com` to read our mail from `gmail.com`. So, the purpose of the "Same Origin" policy is to protect users from information theft.

## Same Origin [#same-origin]

Two URLs are said to have the "same origin" if they have the same protocol, domain and port.

These URLs all share the same origin:

- `http://site.com`
- `http://site.com/`
- `http://site.com/my/page.html`

These ones do not:

- <code>http://<b>www.</b>site.com</code> (another domain: `www.` matters)
- <code>http://<b>site.org</b></code> (another domain: `.org` matters)
- <code><b>https://</b>site.com</code> (another protocol: `https`)
- <code>http://site.com:<b>8080</b></code> (another port: `8080`)

The "Same Origin" policy states that:

- if we have a reference to another window, e.g. a popup created by `window.open` or a window inside `<iframe>`, and that window comes from the same origin, then we have full access to that window.
- otherwise, if it comes from another origin, then we can't access the content of that window: variables, document, anything. The only exception is `location`: we can change it (thus redirecting the user). But we cannot *read* location (so we can't see where the user is now, no information leak).

### In action: iframe

An `<iframe>` tag hosts a separate embedded window, with its own separate `document` and `window` objects.

We can access them using properties:

- `iframe.contentWindow` to get the window inside the `<iframe>`.
- `iframe.contentDocument` to get the document inside the `<iframe>`, короткий аналог `iframe.contentWindow.document`.

When we access something inside the embedded window, the browser checks if the iframe has the same origin. If that's not so then the access is denied (writing to `location` is an exception, it's still permitted).

For instance, let's try reading and writing to `<iframe>` from another origin:

```html run
<iframe src="https://example.com" id="iframe"></iframe>

<script>
  iframe.onload = function() {
    // we can get the reference to the inner window
*!*
    let iframeWindow = iframe.contentWindow; // OK
*/!*
    try {
      // ...but not to the document inside it
*!*
      let doc = iframe.contentDocument; // ERROR
*/!*
    } catch(e) {
      alert(e); // Security Error (another origin)
    }

    // also we can't READ the URL of the page in iframe
    try {
      // Can't read URL from the Location object
*!*
      let href = iframe.contentWindow.location.href; // ERROR
*/!*
    } catch(e) {
      alert(e); // Security Error
    }

    // ...we can WRITE into location (and thus load something else into the iframe)!
*!*
    iframe.contentWindow.location = '/'; // OK
*/!*

    iframe.onload = null; // clear the handler, not to run it after the location change
  };
</script>
```

The code above shows errors for any operations except:

- Getting the reference to the inner window `iframe.contentWindow` - that's allowed.
- Writing to `location`.

Contrary to that, if the `<iframe>` has the same origin, we can do anything with it:

```html run
<!-- iframe from the same site -->
<iframe src="/" id="iframe"></iframe>

<script>
  iframe.onload = function() {
    // just do anything
    iframe.contentDocument.body.prepend("Hello, world!");
  };
</script>
```

```smart header="`iframe.onload` vs `iframe.contentWindow.onload`"
The `iframe.onload` event (on the `<iframe>` tag) is essentially the same as `iframe.contentWindow.onload` (on the embedded window object). It triggers when the embedded window fully loads with all resources.

...But we can't access `iframe.contentWindow.onload` for an iframe from another origin, so using `iframe.onload`.
```

## Windows on subdomains: document.domain

By definition, two URLs with different domains have different origins.

But if windows share the same second-level domain, for instance `john.site.com`, `peter.site.com` and `site.com` (so that their common second-level domain is `site.com`), we can make the browser ignore that difference, so that they can be treated as coming from the "same origin" for the purposes of cross-window communication.

To make it work, each such window should run the code:

```js
document.domain = 'site.com';
```

That's all. Now they can interact without limitations. Again, that's only possible for pages with the same second-level domain.

## Iframe: wrong document pitfall

When an iframe comes from the same origin, and we may access its  `document`, there's a pitfall. It's not related to cross-domain things, but important to know.

Upon its creation an iframe immediately has a document. But that document is different from the one that loads into it!

So if we do something with the document immediately, that will probably be lost.

Here, look:


```html run
<iframe src="/" id="iframe"></iframe>

<script>
  let oldDoc = iframe.contentDocument;
  iframe.onload = function() {
    let newDoc = iframe.contentDocument;
*!*
    // the loaded document is not the same as initial!
    alert(oldDoc == newDoc); // false
*/!*
  };
</script>
```

We shouldn't work with the document of a not-yet-loaded iframe, because that's the *wrong document*. If we set any event handlers on it, they will be ignored.

How to detect the moment when the document is there?

The right document is definitely at place when `iframe.onload`  triggers. But it only triggers when the whole iframe with all resources is loaded.

We can try to catch the moment earlier using checks in `setInterval`:

```html run
<iframe src="/" id="iframe"></iframe>

<script>
  let oldDoc = iframe.contentDocument;

  // every 100 ms check if the document is the new one
  let timer = setInterval(() => {
    let newDoc = iframe.contentDocument;
    if (newDoc == oldDoc) return;

    alert("New document is here!");

    clearInterval(timer); // cancel setInterval, don't need it any more
  }, 100);
</script>
```

## Collection: window.frames

An alternative way to get a window object for `<iframe>` -- is to get it from the named collection  `window.frames`:

- By number: `window.frames[0]` -- the window object for the first frame in the document.
- By name: `window.frames.iframeName` -- the window object for the frame with  `name="iframeName"`.

For instance:

```html run
<iframe src="/" style="height:80px" name="win" id="iframe"></iframe>

<script>
  alert(iframe.contentWindow == frames[0]); // true
  alert(iframe.contentWindow == frames.win); // true
</script>
```

An iframe may have other iframes inside. The corresponding `window` objects form a hierarchy.

Navigation links are:

- `window.frames` -- the collection of "children" windows (for nested frames).
- `window.parent` -- the reference to the "parent" (outer) window.
- `window.top` -- the reference to the topmost parent window.

For instance:

```js run
window.frames[0].parent === window; // true
```

We can use the `top` property to check if the current document is open inside a frame or not:

```js run
if (window == top) { // current window == window.top?
  alert('The script is in the topmost window, not in a frame');
} else {
  alert('The script runs in a frame!');
}
```

## The "sandbox" iframe attribute

The `sandbox` attribute allows for the exclusion of certain actions inside an `<iframe>` in order to prevent it executing untrusted code. It "sandboxes" the iframe by treating it as coming from another origin and/or applying other limitations.

There's a "default set" of restrictions applied for `<iframe sandbox src="...">`. But it can be relaxed if we provide a space-separated list of restrictions that should not be applied as a value of the attribute, like this: `<iframe sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups">`.

In other words, an empty `"sandbox"` attribute puts the strictest limitations possible, but we can put a space-delimited list of those that we want to lift.

Here's a list of limitations:

`allow-same-origin`
: By default `"sandbox"` forces the "different origin" policy for the iframe. In other words, it makes the browser to treat the `iframe` as coming from another origin, even if its `src` points to the same site. With all implied restrictions for scripts. This option removes that feature.

`allow-top-navigation`
: Allows the `iframe` to change `parent.location`.

`allow-forms`
: Allows to submit forms from `iframe`.

`allow-scripts`
: Allows to run scripts from the `iframe`.

`allow-popups`
: Allows to `window.open` popups from the `iframe`

See [the manual](mdn:/HTML/Element/iframe) for more.

The example below demonstrates a sandboxed iframe with the default set of restrictions: `<iframe sandbox src="...">`. It has some JavaScript and a form.

Please note that nothing works. So the default set is really harsh:

[codetabs src="sandbox" height=140]


```smart
The purpose of the `"sandbox"` attribute is only to *add more* restrictions. It cannot remove them. In particular, it can't relax same-origin restrictions if the iframe comes from another origin.
```

## Cross-window messaging

The `postMessage` interface allows windows to talk to each other no matter which origin they are from.

So, it's a way around the "Same Origin" policy. It allows a window from `john-smith.com` to talk to `gmail.com` and exchange information, but only if they both agree and call corresponding JavaScript functions. That makes it safe for users.

The interface has two parts.

### postMessage

The window that wants to send a message calls [postMessage](mdn:api/Window.postMessage) method of the receiving window. In other words, if we want to send the message to `win`, we should call  `win.postMessage(data, targetOrigin)`.

Arguments:

`data`
: The data to send. Can be any object, the data is cloned using the "structured cloning algorithm". IE supports only strings, so we should `JSON.stringify` complex objects to support that browser.

`targetOrigin`
: Specifies the origin for the target window, so that only a window from the given origin will get the message.

The `targetOrigin` is a safety measure. Remember, if the target window comes from another origin, we can't read it's `location` in the sender window. So we can't be sure which site is open in the intended window right now: the user could navigate away, and the sender window has no idea about it.

Specifying `targetOrigin` ensures that the window only receives the data if it's still at the right site. Important when the data is sensitive.

For instance, here `win` will only receive the message if it has a document from the origin `http://example.com`:

```html no-beautify
<iframe src="http://example.com" name="example">

<script>
  let win = window.frames.example;

  win.postMessage("message", "http://example.com");
</script>
```

If we don't want that check, we can set `targetOrigin` to `*`.

```html no-beautify
<iframe src="http://example.com" name="example">

<script>
  let win = window.frames.example;

*!*
  win.postMessage("message", "*");
*/!*
</script>
```


### onmessage

To receive a message, the target window should have a handler on the `message` event. It triggers when `postMessage` is called (and `targetOrigin` check is successful).

The event object has special properties:

`data`
: The data from `postMessage`.

`origin`
: The origin of the sender, for instance `http://javascript.info`.

`source`
: The reference to the sender window. We can immediately `source.postMessage(...)` back if we want.

To assign that handler, we should use `addEventListener`, a short syntax `window.onmessage` does not work.

Here's an example:

```js
window.addEventListener("message", function(event) {
  if (event.origin != 'http://javascript.info') {
    // something from an unknown domain, let's ignore it
    return;
  }

  alert( "received: " + event.data );
  
  // can message back using event.source.postMessage(...)
});
```

The full example:

[codetabs src="postmessage" height=120]

```smart header="There's no delay"
There's totally no delay between `postMessage` and the `message` event. The event triggers synchronously, faster than `setTimeout(...,0)`.
```

## Summary

To call methods and access the content of another window, we should first have a reference to it.

For popups we have these references:
- From the opener window: `window.open` -- opens a new window and returns a reference to it,
- From the popup: `window.opener` -- is a reference to the opener window from a popup.

For iframes, we can access parent/children windows using:
- `window.frames` -- a collection of nested window objects,
- `window.parent`, `window.top` are the references to parent and top windows,
- `iframe.contentWindow` is the window inside an `<iframe>` tag.

If windows share the same origin (host, port, protocol), then windows can do whatever they want with each other.

Otherwise, only possible actions are:
- Change the `location` of another window (write-only access).
- Post a message to it.

Exceptions are:
- Windows that share the same second-level domain: `a.site.com` and `b.site.com`. Then setting `document.domain='site.com'` in both of them puts them into the "same origin" state.
- If an iframe has a `sandbox` attribute, it is forcefully put into the "different origin" state, unless the `allow-same-origin` is specified in the attribute value. That can be used to run untrusted code in iframes from the same site.

The `postMessage` interface allows two windows with any origins to talk:

1. The sender calls `targetWin.postMessage(data, targetOrigin)`.
2. If `targetOrigin` is not `'*'`, then the browser checks if window `targetWin` has the origin `targetOrigin`.
3. If it is so, then `targetWin` triggers the `message` event with special properties:
    - `origin` -- the origin of the sender window (like `http://my.site.com`)
    - `source` -- the reference to the sender window.
    - `data` -- the data, any object in everywhere except IE that supports only strings.

    We should use `addEventListener` to set the handler for this event inside the target window.
